# Clash Royale Data Mining

The following Repository will capture all my data mining activity related to the game Clash Royale. The scripts currently only include an iPython notebook to connect to the Clash Royale API and a SQLALCHEMY ORM which I am using to capture the metadata on my private MYSQL sever.

Future iterations of this notebook aim to include richer visualizations and analytics related to game play activity and card metadata.
